				<h3>Special</h3>

				Recently I attended the senior play of Department of Foreign Languages and Literature of NTHU. Due to the lack of male members that want to act in our department, I automatically became the leading male character, with all my peers being actresses.	
			</p>
			<p>
				To call in a phrase, The job of acting was significantly more difficult then I thought it would be. My character’s name was Charles Condomine, and he was a British novelist living in the mid 20th century. The first and biggest problem I faced was that on stage, I didn’t look anything like a high-classed British gentleman like Charles was; I was accused of sounding like a gangster and walking like a pimp. This failure to portray my character accurately also negatively affected other actresses. There was a scene where Charles had to grab the hands of his wife Ruth, the leading female character; according to our director, the actress playing Ruth “ looked at me as if I were a rapist” instead of her own husband. Part of the difficulty stemmed from me understanding the script differently from all the other actresses and the director herself. At that time, I believed Charles was a more flippant figure whose personality tilted more towards the crazy, emotional side rather than the calm, civil gentleness that my peers expected.
			</p>
			<p>
				I felt very frustrated. I felt like I was picked on; I felt like as the only male in the room, my opinion was being suppressed by all the female opinions. I started to take all the criticisms personally, believing these people didn’t like the Charles I played because I myself was not a gentleman and they didn’t like me.
			</p>
			<p>
				But as we continued practicing, the misunderstanding eventually dissolved and the play turned out great. As it turned out, acting is not only about figuring out what your character would do in the situation given by the scene; it is also largely dependent on good communication between actors, actresses and the director. A group of people will not automatically look at the same things the same way, and it is very important that everyone acting share a common idea about basically everything on stage. I think that is also the most important thing I have learned from attending the senior play: the importance of good  and thorough communication.

				最近我參加了清華大學外語系的畢業公演。有鑒於本系嚴重缺乏願意演戲的男同學，我很自然地變成了男主角，而其他演員全部都是女生。
			</p>
			<p>
				簡而言之，演戲這檔事比我想像的困難多了。我演的角色叫做查爾斯．康德邁，是個生活在20世紀中葉的英國小說家。我首先遇到、也是最大的難題，是我在台上完全沒有查爾斯那種英國上流紳士的樣子；劇組說我說起話來像個流氓、走路的樣子像個痞子。我失敗的詮釋也影響到了其他演員：有一幕中查爾斯要抓住女主角露絲——也就是他的妻子——的手；據導演所說，當時演飾演露絲的演員看我的眼神「彷彿看著強姦犯」而非自己的丈夫。正確詮釋這個角色之所以這麼困難，部分原因是我對劇本和角色的瞭解跟所有其他演員和導演都不一樣。當時我認為查爾斯應該是個個性輕浮的人；對我來說他應該有點瘋癲、有點情緒化，而不是像其他演員和導演所期待的一樣冷靜、體面而溫柔。
			</p>
			<p>
				當時我感到相當挫折。我覺得其他演員和導演都在對我雞蛋裡挑骨頭；就因為我是在場唯一的男性，我的意見就被這些女生打壓。我開始覺得心裡不平衡；我覺得她們之所以不喜歡我演的查爾斯，是因為身為演員的我本身就不是個所謂「紳士」，而他們不喜歡我這個人。
			</p>
			<p>
				這些誤會隨著排練的繼續煙消雲散，最後的演出也非常成功。事實證明，演戲不僅僅是要思索自己的角色在不同場景下會做出什麼反應；要把戲演好，不同演員、以及演員和導演之間溝通良好也是非常重要的。畢竟一群人不會天生就對同一件事有一模一樣的看法，而讓每一個表演者對舞台上發生的一切有一致的看法是非常重要的。我想這也是我參加外語公演所學到最重要的一課：我瞭解了良好、徹底的溝通有多麼重要。
