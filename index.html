			My name is Yu-Jong Wang, but my friends on campus call me Victor.

			In high school I was in an English-French experimental class, thus I received better training in English than other high school students and was introduced to basic French and some French culture. The English training I received in high school was quite challenging in all aspects: we were taught how to give speeches (and I was the English speech contest champion), we watched English films with no subtitles, we read Shakespeare, we had English stage plays. It was where I was equipped with the English skills I have now, and the reason why I applied for the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature.

			In college, The first major decision that I made was to join the track team. I havenâ€™t won any medal, but the track team not only helped me develop the hobby of exercising but also is where I made most of my friends. In terms of study, I found literature classes easier to pass but linguistics classes more interesting in general. My favorite literature class is Study of poetry, and for linguistics I am especially interested in phonetics and phonology, which focus on the sound system of languages. My interest in how languages sound does not only affect my enrollment choices; when preparing for the senior play of the department, it also helps me pay more attention to how my characters should sound like.

			Overall, I would say the education and training I received in college so far has not been very useful in helping me find a job in Taiwan in the future; but even if I could go back in time and choose again, I will still cease the opportunity to obtain knowledge of what I like. Currently I am preparing for a test for a position in the Immigration Agency, which is a job in which my English skills would come in handy.

			Since i am an aquarium hobbyist and keep two crayfish myself, my other website would be about crayfish. It will include introduction of different species and what to be aware of when one staarts to keep crayfish.<br/>
			Crayfish are a type of crustacean, also known as freshwater lobsters.
