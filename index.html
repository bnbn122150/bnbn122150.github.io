				My name is Yu-Jong Wang, but my friends on campus call me Victor.
			</p>
			<p>
				In high school I was in an English-French experimental class, thus I received better training in English than other high school students and was introduced to basic French. The English training I received in high school was quite challenging in all aspects. It was where I was equipped with the English skills I have now, and the reason why I applied for the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature.
			</p>
			<p>
				In college, The first major decision that I made was to join the track team. I fell in love with exercising and made a lot of friends there. In terms of study, my favorite literature class is Study of poetry, and for linguistics I am especially interested in phonetics and phonology, which focus on the sound system of languages. My interest in how languages sound does not only affect my enrollment choices; when preparing for the senior play of the department, it also helps me pay more attention to how my characters should sound like. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, I would say the education and training I received in college so far has not been very useful in helping me find a job in Taiwan in the future; yet I regret not taking this major, for here I obtained the knowledge I enjoy. Currently I am preparing for a test for a position in the Immigration Agency, which is a job in which my English skills would come in handy.

				Since I am an aquarium hobbyist and keep two crayfish myself, my other website would be about crayfish. It will include introduction of different species and what to be aware of when one staarts to keep crayfish.<br/>
			Crayfish are a type of crustacean, also known as freshwater lobsters.<!--testing-->

				我是王裕忠，在大學的朋友都叫我Victor。
			</p>
			<p>
				在高中時我就讀英法實驗班，因此我受到的英語能力訓練比一般人更強，也在高中時就學了一些基本的法語。實驗班所提供的英語訓練包含了聽說讀寫四個層面，非常的全面。在這樣的環境中我培養出了相當不錯的英語能力，也成為我在畢業時選擇進入清華大學外語系的主要原因。
			</p>
			<p>
				在大學期間，我所做的第一個重大決定就是加入田徑隊。在這裡我愛上了運動，更交到了許多好朋友。而在學業方面，我最喜歡的文學科目是詩歌文類，在語言學科目方面我則對探討語言聲音系統的語音學和音韻學特別有興趣。我對於語言聲音的興趣不只影響了我選的選修科目；它也幫助我在準備畢業公演時思考如何塑造角色的獨特語音和腔調。
			</p>
			<p>
				總體而言，我認為我在大學時期受到的教育和訓練對於在台灣的就業市場找到工作並沒有很大的幫助；但我仍不後悔選擇外語系，因為在這裡我的確學到了我有興趣的知識。目前我正在準備國家考試的移民署特考，以期能夠在未來的工作中運用我的英語長才。
